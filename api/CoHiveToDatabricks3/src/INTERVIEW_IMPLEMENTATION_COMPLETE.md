# AI Interview Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

The "Be Interviewed" option in the Wisdom hex is now **fully functional** and connected to your Databricks backend!

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **InterviewDialog Component** (`/components/InterviewDialog.tsx`)

A complete real-time interview interface that:

- ✅ Opens a modal dialog when user clicks "Start Interview"
- ✅ Uses the `AIConversation` class from `/utils/databricksAI.ts`
- ✅ Conducts a 5-question AI interview session
- ✅ Displays messages in a chat-like interface
- ✅ Shows question progress (Question 1 of 5, 2 of 5, etc.)
- ✅ Saves complete transcript to Databricks Knowledge Base
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Provides visual feedback (loading states, completion message)

**Key Features:**
- Real-time AI conversation powered by Databricks Model Serving
- Adaptive questions based on user responses
- Professional UI with purple theme matching the "Interview" branding
- Enter key to send messages
- **Voice-to-text support** - Users can speak their responses using a microphone button
- Auto-completion after 5 questions with summary

---

### 2. **ProcessWireframe.tsx Updates**

**Added:**
- Import for `InterviewDialog` component
- State management for interview dialog (`showInterviewDialog`, `interviewContext`)
- Updated "Start Interview" button handler to:
  - Check Databricks authentication
  - Open the interview dialog
  - Pass context (insight type, brand, project type)
- Interview dialog component at the end of render
- Callback to save transcript to Knowledge Base

**Integration Points:**
- Uses existing `uploadToKnowledgeBase` function
- Uses existing `createFileFromBlob` helper
- Uses existing authentication system
- Follows same patterns as other Wisdom input methods

---

## How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **User selects "Be Interviewed"** in the Wisdom hex input method
2. **Clicks "Start Interview" button**
3. **Authentication check** - if not signed in, prompts to authenticate
4. **Interview dialog opens** with AI interviewer ready
5. **AI asks first question** based on insight type (Brand/Category/General)
6. **User types response** and presses Enter (or clicks Send)
7. **AI asks follow-up questions** (5 total), adapting to user's answers
8. **After 5 questions**, AI provides a summary
9. **User clicks "Save to Knowledge Base"**
10. **Transcript saved to Databricks** with proper metadata
11. **Success notification** shows confirmation
12. **Wisdom hex marked as complete** ✓

## Technical Details

### AI Interview System Prompt

The AI interviewer is configured with:
```
- Role: Expert interviewer conducting wisdom extraction
- Goal: Help user articulate insights through thoughtful questions
- Style: Open-ended, conversational, encouraging
- Question count: Exactly 5 questions
- Output: Summary of key insights at the end
```

### Data Saved to Knowledge Base

Each interview transcript includes:

**File Format:**
```
AI Interview Session - {InsightType} Insights
Date: {timestamp}
Brand: {brand}
Project Type: {projectType}
Interviewer: AI Assistant
Interviewee: {userEmail}

=== Interview Transcript ===

Interviewer: {question 1}

You: {answer 1}

Interviewer: {question 2}

You: {answer 2}

...
```

**Metadata:**
- `fileType`: 'Wisdom'
- `insightType`: 'Brand' | 'Category' | 'General'
- `inputMethod`: 'Interview'
- `scope`: 'brand' | 'category' | 'general'
- `brand`: (if applicable)
- `projectType`: (if applicable)
- `tags`: [insightType, 'Interview']

---

## Backend Requirements

### ✅ Already Implemented:
- `/api/databricks/ai/prompt.js` - Used by `AIConversation` class
- `/api/databricks/knowledge-base/upload` - Used to save transcript
- OAuth authentication system
- File upload utilities

### ⚠️ Verify These Are Working:

1. **Databricks Model Serving Endpoint**
   - Endpoint must be configured and accessible
   - Model should support conversational prompts
   - Default model: `databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct`

2. **Knowledge Base Upload Permissions**
   - User must have write access to Unity Catalog
   - Knowledge Base path must exist
   - File metadata must be stored properly

3. **API Routes Are Deployed**
   - `/api/databricks/ai/prompt.js` should be deployed
   - `/api/databricks/knowledge-base/upload` should be deployed
   - Both should handle authentication properly

## Testing the Feature

### Manual Test Steps:

1. **Navigate to Wisdom hex**
   ```
   Launch → Wisdom
   ```

2. **Select Insight Type**
   ```
   Choose: Brand / Category / General
   ```

3. **Select Input Method**
   ```
   Choose: Be Interviewed
   ```

4. **Start Interview**
   ```
   Click "Start Interview" button
   → Should check authentication
   → Should open dialog with AI's first question
   ```

5. **Answer Questions**
   ```
   Type response in text box
   OR
   Click microphone button to speak your response
   Press Enter or click Send
   → AI should ask next question
   → Repeat 5 times
   ```

6. **Complete Interview**
   ```
   After 5 questions:
   → AI shows summary
   → Green checkmark appears
   → "Save to Knowledge Base" button enabled
   ```

7. **Save Transcript**
   ```
   Click "Save to Knowledge Base"
   → Loading indicator appears
   → Success alert shown
   → Dialog closes
   → Wisdom hex marked complete
   ```

8. **Verify in Databricks**
   ```
   Check Unity Catalog for:
   → File named: Wisdom_{InsightType}_Interview_{timestamp}.txt
   → fileType: 'Wisdom'
   → inputMethod: 'Interview'
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to start interview"
**Cause:** AI API not responding  
**Fix:** Check Databricks Model Serving endpoint is running

### Issue: "Not authenticated" error
**Cause:** OAuth token expired or missing  
**Fix:** Click "Sign In" in header to re-authenticate

### Issue: "Failed to save transcript"
**Cause:** Knowledge Base upload permissions  
**Fix:** Verify Unity Catalog write permissions

### Issue: AI responses are slow
**Cause:** Model endpoint cold start  
**Fix:** Normal for first request; subsequent requests will be faster

### Issue: Interview doesn't end after 5 questions
**Cause:** System prompt not properly instructing AI  
**Fix:** Check the system prompt in `InterviewDialog.tsx` (line 35-53)

### Issue: Microphone button not appearing
**Cause:** Browser doesn't support Web Speech API  
**Fix:** Use Chrome, Edge, or Safari (Firefox doesn't support Speech Recognition yet)

### Issue: "Speech recognition is not supported"
**Cause:** Using an incompatible browser or HTTP (not HTTPS)  
**Fix:** Use HTTPS and a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)

## Configuration Options

### Adjust Number of Questions

Edit `/components/InterviewDialog.tsx`:
```typescript
const maxQuestions = 5; // Change to desired number (line 29)
```

### Customize AI Interviewer Personality

Edit the `systemPrompt` in `/components/InterviewDialog.tsx` (lines 35-53):
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert interviewer...
- Make more formal
- Ask deeper questions
- Focus on specific topics
- etc.
```

### Change Model Endpoint

The interview uses whatever model is configured in `/utils/databricksAI.ts`:
```typescript
export const DATABRICKS_MODELS = {
  LLAMA_3_1_70B: 'databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct',
  LLAMA_3_1_405B: 'databricks-meta-llama-3-1-405b-instruct',
  // etc.
}
```
