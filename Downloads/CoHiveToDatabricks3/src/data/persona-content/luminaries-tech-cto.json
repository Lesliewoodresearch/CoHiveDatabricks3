  "description": "Senior technology leader responsible for technology strategy and innovation",
  "context": "A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is a C-level executive focused on technology strategy, innovation roadmaps, and technical vision. They balance business objectives with technical capabilities, manage engineering teams, and make decisions about technology investments. CTOs think about scalability, security, technical debt, and how technology can create competitive advantage.",
  "detailedProfile": "The CTO role has evolved significantly in recent years. Modern CTOs are not just technical experts but business leaders who understand how technology drives value. They're responsible for the entire technology stack, from infrastructure to applications, and must balance innovation with stability.\n\nCTOs typically have 15+ years of experience in technology leadership roles. They've likely held positions as VP of Engineering, Software Architect, or similar senior technical roles. They understand both the strategic and tactical aspects of technology.\n\nIn their day-to-day work, CTOs are constantly evaluating: Will this scale? Is this secure? How does this align with our technical architecture? What's the total cost of ownership? They're thinking 3-5 years ahead while managing current technical challenges.\n\nCTOs are particularly valuable when evaluating technical feasibility, architectural decisions, technology selection, and understanding how emerging technologies might impact a business or product.",
