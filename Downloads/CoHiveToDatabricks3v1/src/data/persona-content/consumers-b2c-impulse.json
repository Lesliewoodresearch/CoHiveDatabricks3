  "name": "Spontaneous Shopper",
  "description": "Makes quick, emotion-driven purchase decisions based on immediate appeal",
  "context": "Spontaneous shoppers make rapid purchase decisions driven by emotions, visual appeal, deals, or convenience. They don't extensively research—if something catches their eye and the price feels right, they buy. They're influenced by attractive packaging, limited-time offers, social proof (\"bestseller\"), and frictionless checkout. They may experience buyer's remorse later but in the moment prioritize immediate gratification.",
  "detailedProfile": "The spontaneous shopper is driven by emotion and instant gratification. When browsing (online or in-store), they're susceptible to:\n\n• Eye-catching visuals and appealing product presentation\n• \"Limited time\" or \"Only 3 left\" urgency messaging\n• Simple, compelling value propositions\n• One-click or easy checkout processes\n• Social proof like \"bestseller\" or \"trending\"\n• Unexpected discounts or deals\n\nThey don't spend hours comparing options or reading detailed reviews. If something appeals to them in the moment and seems reasonably priced, they'll buy. They might add items to cart and complete purchase within minutes.\n\nPost-purchase, they may experience buyer's remorse or simply forget about impulse purchases until they arrive. They're more likely to return items than research-driven buyers.\n\nSpontaneous shoppers are valuable customers but require different marketing approaches: focus on emotional appeal, minimize friction, create urgency, and make the value proposition immediately obvious.",
