# Wisdom Hex Documentation

## Overview

The Wisdom hex ("Share Your Wisdom") allows users to contribute insights about brands, categories, or general market knowledge to the CoHive knowledge base. These insights are **stored directly in Databricks** (not localStorage) for centralized, persistent storage accessible to all users across the organization. Files become available as context for AI processing in other workflow steps.

---

## User Flow

### Step 1: Select Insight Type

User chooses what type of insight they're sharing:

- **About a Brand** - Specific insights about a particular brand

## Data Structure

### Wisdom File Format

```typescript
{
  id: string,                    // Unique timestamp-based ID
  brand: string,                 // From Enter step or 'General'
  projectType: string,           // From Enter step or 'General'
  fileName: string,              // Auto-generated with pattern
  isApproved: boolean,           // Always true for Wisdom
  uploadDate: number,            // Timestamp
  fileType: 'Wisdom',           // Special type for filtering
  content: string                // Base64 for files, plain text for text
}
```

### Filename Patterns

- **Text**: `Wisdom_[InsightType]_[Timestamp].txt`
- **Voice**: `Wisdom_[InsightType]_Voice_[Timestamp].webm` (recorded audio)
- **Photo Upload**: `Wisdom_[InsightType]_Photo_[OriginalFilename]`
- **Photo Capture**: `Wisdom_[InsightType]_Captured_[Timestamp].jpg`
- **Video Upload**: `Wisdom_[InsightType]_Video_[OriginalFilename]`
- **Video Record**: `Wisdom_[InsightType]_Recorded_[Timestamp].webm`
- **File Upload**: `Wisdom_[InsightType]_File_[OriginalFilename]`

**Examples:**
- `Wisdom_Brand_1738927456789.txt`
- `Wisdom_Category_Voice_1738927456789.webm`
- `Wisdom_General_Photo_consumer_behavior.jpg`
- `Wisdom_Brand_Captured_1738927456789.jpg`
- `Wisdom_Category_Video_product_demo.mp4`
- `Wisdom_General_Recorded_1738927456789.webm`
- `Wisdom_Brand_File_market_research.pdf`
- `Wisdom_Category_File_sales_data.xlsx`

---

## Storage

### Databricks Integration

In production, wisdom files should be:

1. **Uploaded to Databricks** via API endpoint
2. **Stored in Unity Catalog** or Databricks Volumes
3. **Indexed for retrieval** by AI agents
4. **Made searchable** by brand, category, type, etc.

**API Call (Future)**:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/databricks-save-wisdom', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    insightType: 'Brand',
    inputMethod: 'Text',
    brand: 'Nike',
    projectType: 'Creative Messaging',
    fileName: 'Wisdom_Brand_1738927456789.txt',
    content: 'Base64 or text content...'
  })
});
```

---

## Features

### Progressive Disclosure

Questions appear sequentially:
1. Insight Type shows first
2. Input Method shows only after Insight Type selected
3. Share Your Wisdom shows only after both are selected

This guides users through the flow naturally.

### Native Media Capture

**Voice Recording**:
- Uses browser MediaRecorder API
- Direct microphone access (no file upload)
- Real-time recording indicator with pulsing animation
- One-click start/stop recording
- Automatically saves as .webm audio file

**Photo Capture**:
- Two options: Upload existing file OR capture with camera
- Uses getUserMedia API for camera access
- Live camera preview before capture
- Single button click captures frame
- Saves as .jpg with 90% quality

**Video Recording**:
- Two options: Upload existing file OR record with camera
- Uses MediaRecorder API with video stream
- Live camera preview during recording
- Start/stop controls with recording indicator
- Automatically saves as .webm video file

### Auto-Save on Capture/Upload

For all media types:
- Files automatically saved to knowledge base on capture/upload/recording complete
- No separate "Save" button needed (except for text)
- Success message confirms save
- Console log shows saved data structure

### Text Input Save Button

For text input:
- Multi-line textarea for longer insights
- "Save to Knowledge Base" button appears when text is entered
- Button click saves to knowledge base and shows confirmation

### File Size Warnings

For video uploads:
- Warning message about file size limits

## Integration with Other Hexes

### Knowledge Base Access

Wisdom contributions become part of the research files pool and can be:

1. **Selected in CentralHexView** - Available for "New Synthesis" mode
2. **Referenced by AI** - Used as context in assessments/recommendations
3. **Filtered by type** - Can filter to show only "Wisdom" type files
4. **Searched** - Searchable in Knowledge Base management

### AI Context Enhancement

When executing workflow hexes:
- Wisdom files provide additional context
- Help AI understand brand/category nuances
- Enrich recommendations with crowdsourced insights
- Build institutional knowledge over time

---

## File Size Considerations

### Storage Limits

**localStorage Limits**: 5-10 MB per domain

**Recommendations**:
- **Text**: Unlimited practical length (few KB)
- **Voice**: Keep under 5 MB (about 5 minutes at 128kbps)
- **Photo**: Compress to < 2 MB if possible
- **Video**: Keep clips under 30 seconds or use lower quality

### Future: Direct Databricks Upload

For production deployment, implement:

```typescript
// Upload directly to Databricks, store only reference locally
const uploadToDatabricks = async (file: File) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  formData.append('insightType', insightType);
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/databricks-upload-wisdom', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
  
  const { fileId, path } = await response.json();
  
  // Store only reference in localStorage
  const reference = {
    id: fileId,
    path: path,
    fileName: file.name,
    // ... other metadata
  };
  
  return reference;
};
```

This avoids localStorage limits and enables large file uploads.
